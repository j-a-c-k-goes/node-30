# Errors in Node.js

Errors are any unexpected issue causing the program/application to crash, halt execution, and /or not function properly. 

The `error` object captures a stack trace which details the point in the code where `error` originated. 

All errors in node are instantiated from `error` class or are an instance of the `error` class.
